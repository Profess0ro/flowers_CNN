# Flower image prediction

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurito/flower-photos

## Hypotheses

1. Does one flower color outstand others in the evaluation of the training?

2. Does one more layer in the model change the outcome of the training?

3. Does a over-/undersampling of the image dataset make a better result?

4. Will the model learn better with the mean image shape (365x271) or with 224x224?
