## Dataset content

The dataset contains 29360 images with 5 different types of flowers, and can be found at [Flower dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurito/flower-photos).<br>The flower species that are represented are: daisys, dandelions, sunflowers, roses and tulips.<br>All images in this archive are licensed under the Creative Commons By-Attribution License. <br>To see all the photographers listed, [read this](Image_LICENSE.txt).

## Business requirements

A primary school is interested in using a "Flower bingo" so that the children can learn about some of the most common flowers in a more fun and creative way. <br>The company that develops the app for the primary school wants a machine classifier that has high prediction accuracy.<br> The company also provided a suggested dataset of images.

- The client requires that the dataset are studied and results are visualised.
- The client wants us to develop a machine learning model that can predict with an accuracy higher than 80%.
- The Client needs a dashboard where they can try our model with live images.


## Hypotheses and how to validate them


1. Will the model have problems to seperate flowers that has the same color?<br>- We will add the amount of kernels in the later layers to see if the performance will improve.

2. A deep learning model with convolutional neaural network (CNN) should handle the classification of the different flowers
<br>- We will use CNN to train the model then test the performance

3. Does a balanced set of the image dataset make a better result?
<br>- We will try the model with unbalanced and balanced sets and then compare the results.

4. Tuning the hyperparameters will improve the performance of the model.
<br>- Test with basic settings then tune to get a better score.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the data visualizations and ML tasks

### Purpose and goals with the project

The project is to create a "Flower bingo"-app to help school children learn to recognize common flowers. Meeting the clients requirements and delivering a user-friendly solution requires specific data and visualization steps as well as machine learning models to achive the expected performance.

1.  **Visualization of the dataset for insight and understanding.**
<br>The client wish an analysis and visualization of the dataset, to achieve this we will:<br>- *Image frequency of all categories:* <br>We will visualize the amount of all images through all categories to get a insight if the dataset is balanced or not. Unbalanced categories can affect the performance.
<br>- *Color distribution:* <br>An analysis of the colors will be visualized to determine if the colors are suffiectly distinct between the flower types. This is important if the dataset has many flowers with the same colors.

2.  **Build a machine learning model for classification of the flowers.**
<br>The client demands a model with atleast 80% accuracy to ensure that the app can deliver correct predictions.<br>- *Choice of model:*<br>
We have chosen a convolutional neaural network (CNN) as these are known for their strength in image classification. The CNN will be trained to identify the different visual patterns of the flowers.<br>- *Validation:*<br>
To meet the high demand of the accuracy we will test the model with different hyperparameter settings and document the result of each version. The performance of the deployed version will be shown at the dashboard.

3. **Dashboard for interaction and testing with new data**
<br>An important part of the requirements is an interactive dashboard so the users can test the model with their own images.<br>- *Implementation of the model test interface:*<br>The dashboard will integrate a feature where the user can upload an image and get instant feedback on which flower it is.<br>- *Galleries with each flower:*<br>The dashboard will have a page where the user can choose a flower and then see a gallery with random images of that flower.

## CRISP-DM Framework and Its Application in This Project

This project adheres to the CRISP-DM framework (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), a widely used methodology in data science. It ensures a structured and repeatable approach to solving machine learning problems. <br>Below, we outline how each phase was applied:

- ### Business Understanding

The primary goal of this project was to create an educational application for primary school children to identify and classify flowers using a machine learning model. <br>**The business requirements included:**<br>
- Developing a flower classification model with at least 80% accuracy.<br>
- Creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard for teachers and students to explore flowers.<br>
- Providing visual insights into flower data to enhance the educational value of the application.<br>

**Key questions to address:**

*Can the model accurately classify flowers into five categories: daisy, rose, sunflower, tulip, and dandelion?*<br>
*How can we make the dashboard accessible and engaging for a young audience?*

- ### Data Understanding
The dataset consisted of 29,360 labeled flower images across 5 categories.<br> Key insights from the initial analysis:

**Image Variability:**<br> Images had varying dimensions, color distributions, and lighting conditions.<br>
**Imbalance:**<br> Some flower categories, like daisies, had fewer images compared to others like dandelions.<br>
**Data Quality:**<br> No missing or corrupted image files were identified.
We visualized the dataset to understand its distribution and to identify potential challenges for the model.

- ### Data Preparation
To ensure the dataset was ready for modeling, we performed the following steps:<br>
**Resizing and Normalization:**<br> Standardized all images to a uniform size for compatibility with the model.<br>
**Augmentation:**<br> Used techniques such as rotation, zoom, and flipping to increase the dataset's diversity and improve model generalization.<br>
**Splitting:**<br> Divided the data into train (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets.<br>
**Class Balancing:**<br> Addressed imbalances by augmenting underrepresented classes.

- ### Modeling
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed using TensorFlow.<br> *Key features of the model:*<br>
**Architecture:**<br> The model included multiple convolutional layers, BatchNormalization, and dropout to mitigate overfitting.<br>
**Optimization:**<br> Hyperparameters were tuned iteratively, focusing on learning rate, filter sizes, and number of layers.<br>
**Loss Function:**<br> Categorical Cross-Entropy was used for multi-class classification.<br>
**Model performance** was evaluated using the validation set, achieving an accuracy of 82%.

- ### Evaluation
Model evaluation was conducted on the test set and through visual tools.<br>*Key results:*<br>
**Accuracy:**<br> The model exceeded the target accuracy of 80%.<br>
**Confusion Matrix:**<br> Highlighted that the model struggled to differentiate between roses and tulips, prompting further investigation.<br>
**Classification Report:**<br> Detailed precision, recall, and F1 scores for all categories.<br>
**Future Improvements:**<br>
To address challenges in distinguishing roses and tulips, future work may include:<br>
*More advanced feature extraction techniques for color and texture.*<br>
*Collecting additional high-quality images for these categories.*

- ### Deployment
The final model was integrated into a Streamlit-based dashboard and deployed on Render.<br>*Key features of the dashboard:*<br>
**Interactive Predictions:**<br> Users can upload flower images and receive predictions with probability scores.<br>
**Visual Insights:**<br> Includes plots for dataset distribution, model performance, and predictions.<br>
**User-Centric Design:**<br> The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and accessible for non-technical users, including children.<br>

### Why CRISP-DM?
The CRISP-DM methodology provided a clear structure for this project, ensuring that every phase was aligned with the business goals. By following this framework, we were able to:<br>- Maintain focus on the clientâs requirements.<br>- Systematically address challenges during data preparation and modeling.<br>- Deliver a robust and user-friendly application for real-world use.<br>
**Next Steps:**<br>
Based on the project findings, the following actions are recommended:<br>- Further optimize the model for better differentiation between roses and tulips.<br>- Expand the dataset to include more diverse flower images.<br>- Explore advanced modeling techniques such as transfer learning for improved performance.

**How to improve this:**<br>
To get a better performance between these two categories I would investigate more specific technics that can extract functions to color deviances and the structure of the petals.

## Problems encountered

1. **Slow model run** <br>Started model run without rescaling to preferred image size (224 x 224). Instead ran the model with original size and the performance was really bad!<br>**- Solution:** added `input_shape=(224, 224, 3)` to the model and the performance greatly increased, aslo the runtime went down very much!

2. **Pushing large amount to GitHub**<br> Since the images total size is over 2Gb when having both raw and balanced image sets. The commits IÂ´ve made for a while didnÂ´t upload since IÂ´ve overrided the standardlimit of 2Gb per push.<br>**Solution:** Copied my files on the computer then made a hard reset. Then copied the files with changes and then added `inputs/` in `.gitignore`
