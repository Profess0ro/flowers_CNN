            ðŸŒ» **General info:**
            
            A primary school wants to teach children about five of the most common flowers in a more interactive way. 
            They came up with the idea of a "flower-bingo," where children can upload photos 
            (with help from their parents) into an app with a bingo tray.

            The squares in the bingo tray will be marked when a photo of that flower is uploaded. 
            To ensure that the flowers are being marked correctly, 
            the school reached out and wanted an app that can predict flowers from photos.

            As a data analyst, Iâ€™ve been tasked with creating a prediction tool for this app that achieves an accuracy of over 80%. 
            To accomplish this, Iâ€™m going to build a machine learning classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
            to accurately classify flower species based on images.
